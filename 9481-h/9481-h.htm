<p>It is as difficult to say when the umbrella came, or where it came from, as<br>
it is to tell where it goes to. Rumor hath it, however, that it came in<br>
(that is, out of the rain) with NOAH. The story (as given us by an<br>
antiquarian relative) says that when the Ark was built the camelopard was<br>
forgotten, and it was found necessary to cut a hole in the roof to<br>
accommodate the animal's neck. This done, SHEM sat upon the roof and held<br>
an umbrella. SHEM thus <i>raised</i> the umbrella. Then our further<br>
question follows, Where did he raise it? Evidently he raised the umbrella<br>
on the Ark.</p>

<p>These theories seem to us to be entitled to serious consideration; and<br>
certainly it is a reasonable belief that, as the present suffering from the<br>
high price of clothing is due to the sin of our first parents, so the<br>
umbrella is the curse entailed by royalty, coming in with the First Reign<br>
spoken of in history.</p>

<p>The umbrella appears again in ancient time in connection with DANIEL, who,<br>
it is said, carried one into the lions' den. The authority for this is a<br>
historical painting that has fallen into the hands of an itinerant showman.<br>
A curious fact is stated with reference to this picture, namely, that<br>
DANIEL so closely resembled the lions in personal appearance that it was<br>
necessary for the showman to state that "DANIEL might easily be<br>
distinguished from the lions on account of the blue cotton umbrella under<br>
his right arm."</p>

<p>For what purpose this umbrella may have been carried we can only surmise.</p>

<p>The most probable theory is, that it was to be used there to intimidate the<br>
lions, as it has since been used toward mad bulls and other ferocious<br>
beasts.</p>

<p>We have now taken hold pretty firmly of what may be called the handle of<br>
the umbrella. We have learned that, as ADAM raised CAIN, NOAH raised the<br>
umbrella, and DANIEL carried one.</p>

<p>We have learned further that the umbrella carried by DANIEL was a blue<br>
cotton umbrella&mdash;undoubtedly the most primitive type of the umbrella.</p>

<p>It is one of this class that your country friend brings down with him, that<br>
darkeneth the heavens as with a canopy and maketh you ashamed of your<br>
company. It is such an umbrella as this that is to be found or might have<br>
been found, in ancient days, in every old farm-house&mdash;one that covered the<br>
whole household when it went to church, occupying as much room when closed<br>
as would the tent of an Arab.</p>

<p>We have heard it said that it was the impossibility of two umbrellas of<br>
this nature passing each other on a narrow road which led to the invention<br>
of covered wagons.</p>

<p>There is nothing lovely about a blue cotton umbrella, though there may have<br>
been <i>under</i> it at times and seasons. Skeletons of the species, much<br>
faded as to color, much weakened as to whalebone, may still be found here<br>
and there in backwoods settlements, where they are known as "umbrells;"<br>
there are but few perfect specimens in existence.</p>

<p>The present style of the umbrella is varied, and sometimes elegant. The<br>
cover is of silk; the ribs are of steel oftener than of bone, and the<br>
handle is wrought into divers quaint and beautiful shapes. The most common<br>
kind is the <i>hooked umbrella</i>. Most people have hooked umbrellas&mdash;or,<br>
if this statement be offensive to any one, we will say that most people<br>
have had umbrellas hooked. The chance resemblance of this expression to one<br>
signifying to obstruct illegally that which properly belongs to another,<br>
reminds us to speak of the singular fact that the umbrella is not property.<br>
This is important. It rests on judicial decision, and becomes more<br>
important when we remember that by similar decision the negro is property,<br>
and that, therefore, until emancipation, the umbrella was superior to the<br>
negro. The judicial decision cited will be found reported in <i>Vanity<br>
Fair</i>, liber 3, page 265, and was on this wise: A man being arraigned<br>
for stealing an umbrella, pleaded that it rained at the time, and he had no<br>
umbrella. On these grounds he was discharged, and the judge took the<br>
umbrella. (We may notice here how closely this decision has been followed,<br>
even down to modern times, and touching other matters than umbrellas.)</p>

<p>This established the fact that the umbrella was not property that could be<br>
bought, sold, and stolen, but a free gift of the manufacturer to universal<br>
creation. The right of ownership in umbrellas ranked henceforward with our<br>
right to own the American continent, being merely a right by discovery.</p>

Depressing for Chicago.</p>

<p>
The Chicago press has given up all hopes of the PRINCE OF WALES since he<br>
has proved his innocence in regard to Lady MORDAUNT. Chicago had begun to<br>
look upon him with mildly patronizing favor, when he was accused of a share<br>
in a really first-class divorce case; but now that his innocence is<br>
established, there is no longer any extenuating circumstance which can<br>
induce Chicago to overlook the infamous crime of his royal birth.</p>

<hr>
<p>Latest from the Isthmus of Suez.</p>

<p>
Of all men, the followers of MOHAMMED are the most candid; since no matter<br>
of what you accuse them, they always acknowledge the Koran.</p>

<hr>
<p>Right and Left.</p>

<p>Because the P.&amp; O. Directors have suspended their EYRE, we are not called<br>
upon to suspend our anger. We decline to believe that he can justify<br>
himself in leaving the Oneida, however blameless he may have been in the<br>
matter of the collision. Because the Oneida was Left it does not follow<br>
that the Bombay was Right.</p>

<p>Mr. BOUCICAULT might properly be called the author of the elementary Drama.
Not because his plays, like elementary lessons in French, are peculiarly
aggravating to the well-regulated mind, but because of his fondness for
employing one of the elements of nature&mdash;fire, water, or golden hair&mdash;in
the production of the sensation which invariably takes place in the fourth
or fifth act of each of his popular dramas. In the <i>Streets of
New-York</i>, he made a hit by firing a building at the spectacularly
disposed audience. In <i>Formosa</i>, he gave us a boat-race; and in
<i>Lost at Sea</i>, now running at WALLACK'S, he has renewed his former
fondness for playing with fire. The following condensed version of this
play is offered to the readers of PUNCHINELLO, with the assurance that,
though it may be a little more coherent than the unabridged edition, it is
a faithful picture of the sort of thing that Mr. BOUCICAULT, aided and
abetted by Mr. WALLACK, thinks proper to offer to the public.</p>

I have drank, eaten, smoked, chewed, and snuffed opium for ninety years. I<br>

faces are&mdash;Real fire; EFFIE GERMON is&mdash;Real fire; Come and take&mdash;Real fire;<br>
JIM WALLACK is always at home in&mdash;Real fire; There is nothing in the play<br>
but&mdash;Real fire."</p>

<p><i>Misanthropic Critic, to gentlemanly Treasurer</i>. "Can I have two seats<br>
for to-morrow night?"</p>

<p><i>Treasurer</i>. "All sold, sir. Play draws better than <i>Ours</i>!"</p>

<p><i>Misanthropic Critic</i>. Well! no matter. I only wanted to send my<br>
mother-in-law, knowing that the house must take fire some night. However,<br>
I'll read the play to her instead; if she survives that, she isn't mortal.</p>

<hr>
<p><i>Suggestion kindly made to Manager Moss</i>.&mdash;Have the fire scene take<br>
place in the first act, and let all the <i>dramatis personae</i> perish in<br>
the flames. Thus shall the audience be spared the vulgar profanity of<br>
STODDART'S "Comic Villain," the absurdity of WALLACK'S "Coram," the twaddle<br>
of HIELD'S "Virtuous Banker," and the impossible imbecility of FISHER'S<br>
"Unprincipled Clerk." Miss GERMON in trowsers, and Miss HENRIQUES in tears,<br>
are very nice; but they do not quite redeem the wretchedness of the play.<br>
The sooner Mr. Moss gives up his present flame and returns to his early<br>
love&mdash;legitimate comedy&mdash;the better.</p>

<h3>HOW TO BEHAVE AT A THEATRE.</h3></center>

<center>
<table summary="">
<tr><td>

<p>
MR. PUNCHINELLO: I take it you are willing to receive useful information.<br>
Of course you are&mdash;Why? Because, while you may be humorous, you intend also<br>
to be sensible. I have in my day been to the theatre not a little. I have<br>
seen many plays and many audiences. I know&mdash;or, at least, think I do&mdash;what<br>
is good acting, and&mdash;what good manners. Suffer me, then, briefly to give<br>
you a few hints as to how an audience should behave. I shall charge nothing<br>
for the information, though I am frank to insinuate that it is worth a<br>
deal&mdash;of the value, perhaps, of a great deal table.</p>

<p>First. Always take a lady with you to the play. It will please her,<br>
whatever the bother to you. Besides, you will then be talked to. If you<br>
make a mess of it in trying to unravel the plot, she will essentially aid<br>
you in that direction. Nothing like a woman for a plot&mdash;especially if you<br>
desire to plunge head foremost into one.</p>

<p>Second. If you have any loud conversation to indulge in, do it while the<br>
play is going on. Possibly it may disturb your neighbors; but you do not<br>
ask them to hear it. Hail Columbia! isn't this a free country? If you have<br>
any private and confidential affairs to talk over, the theatre is the place<br>
in which to do it. Possibly strangers may not comprehend all the bearings;<br>
but that is not your fault. You do your best&mdash;who can do better?</p>

<p>Third. If you have an overcoat or any other garment, throw it across the<br>
adjoining or front seat. Never mind any protests of frown or word. Should<br>
not people be willing to accommodate? Of course they should. Prove it by<br>
putting your dripping umbrella against the lady with the nice moire antique<br>
silk. It may ruffle her temper; but that's her business, not yours; she<br>
shouldn't be ridiculous because well dressed.</p>

<p>Fourth. Try and drop your opera-glass half a dozen times of an evening. If<br>
it makes a great racket&mdash;as of course it will&mdash;and rolls a score of seats<br>
off, hasten at once to obtain possession of the frisky instrument. Let<br>
these little episodes be done at a crisis in the play where the finest<br>
points are being evolved.</p>

<p>Fifth. Of course you carry a cane&mdash;a very ponderous cane. What for? To use<br>
it, obviously. Contrive to do so when every body is silent. What's the use<br>
in being demonstrative in a crowd? It don't pay. Besides, you dog, you know<br>
your <i>forte</i> is in being odd. Odd fellow-you. See it in your<br>
brain&mdash;only half of one. Make a point to bring down your cane when there is<br>
none, (point, not cane,) and shout out "Good!" or "Bravo!" when you have<br>
reason to believe other people are going to be quiet.</p>

<p>Sixth. Never go in till after a play begins, and invariably leave in the<br>
middle of an act, and in the most engaging scene.</p>

<p>These are but a few hints. However, I trust they are good as far as they<br>
go. I may send you a half-dozen more. In the mean time I remain</p>

<p>Yours, truly,</p>

<p>O. FOGY.</p>

<p>
Almost since the world began, people have been interested in and<br>
entertained by gossip respecting the personal habits and individual<br>
idiosyncrasies of popular writers and orators. It is a universal and<br>
undying characteristic of human nature. No age has been exempt from it from<br>
PLINY'S time down to BEECHER'S. It may suitably be called the scarlet-fever<br>
of curiosity, and rash indeed must be the writer who refuses or neglects to<br>
furnish any food for the scandal-monger's maw. While we deprecate in the<br>
strongest terms the custom which persists in lifting the veil of<br>
personality from the forehead of the great, respect for traditional usages<br>
and obligation to the present, as well as veneration for the future, impels<br>
us to reveal some things that are not generally known concerning the men<br>
who are playing "leading business" on the world's great stage of to-day.</p>

<p>For instance, mankind is generally ignorant of the fact that Mr. SUMNER<br>
bathes twice a day in a compound, two thirds of which is water and one<br>
third milk, and that he dictates most of his speeches to a stenographer<br>
while reclining in the bath-tub. WENDELL PHILLIPS is said to have written<br>
the greater portion of his famous lecture on "The Lost Arts" on the backs<br>
of old envelopes while waiting for a train in the Boston depot. Mr. GEORGE<br>
W. CURTIS prepares his mind for writing by sleeping with his head encased<br>
in a nightcap lined with leaves of lavender and rose. GRANT, it is said,<br>
accomplishes most of his writing while under the influence of either opium<br>
or chloroform, which will account for the soothing character of his state<br>
papers. WALT WHITMAN writes most of his poetry in the dissecting-room of<br>
the Medical College, where he has a desk fitted up in close proximity to<br>
the operating table. Mr. DANA is said to write most of his editorials in<br>
one of the parlors of the Manhattan Club, arrayed in black broadcloth from<br>
the sole of his head to the crown of his foot, his hands encased in corn-<br>
colored kids, a piece of chewing-gum in his mouth, and a bottle of Cherry<br>
Pectoral by his side. The report that he eats fish every morning for his<br>
breakfast is untrue: he rejects FISH. COLFAX writes all his speeches and<br>
lectures with his feet in hot water, and his head wrapped in a moist towel.<br>
His greatest vice, next to being Vice-President, is to insist upon having<br>
his writing desk in front of a mirror. BUTLER accomplishes most of his<br>
literary labor over a dish of soup, which he absorbs through the medium of<br>
two of his favorite weapons, thus keeping both his hands employed, and<br>
dictating to an amanuensis every time his mouth enjoys a vacation. BEECHER<br>
has several methods by which he prepares his mind to write a sermon: By<br>
riding up and down Broadway on the top of a stage; visiting the Academy of<br>
Anatomy, or spending a few hours at the Bloomingdale Retreat. Neither<br>
HOLMES nor WHITTIER are able to write a line of poetry until they are<br>
brought in contact with the blood of freshly-slain animals; while, on the<br>
other hand, LONGFELLOW'S only dissipation previous to poetic effort, is a<br>
dish of baked beans. FORNEY vexes his gigantic intellect with iced water<br>
and tobacco, (of the latter, "two papers, both daily.") Mr. TILTON composes<br>
as he reposes in his night-dress, with his hair powdered and "a strawberry<br>
mark upon his left arm." Mr. PARTON writes with his toes, his hands being<br>
employed meanwhile knitting hoods for the destitute children of Alaska. Mr.<br>
P. is a philanthropist. BAYARD TAYLOR writes only in his sleep or while in<br>
a trance state&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that he lives in the State of<br>
Pennsylvania. He will then dictate enough to require the services of three<br>
or four stenographers, and in the morning is ready to attend to the<br>
laborious and exacting duties attached to the position of stockholder in<br>
the New-York <i>Tribune</i>. Mr. GREELEY conceives some of his most<br>
brilliant editorial articles while churning the mercurial milk of the<br>
Chappaqua farm into butter; or vexing the gracious grain with the flying<br>
flail; or listening to the pensive murmurings of the plaintive pigs, and<br>
the whispered cadences of the kindly cattle. RICHARD GRANT WHITE can't<br>
write, it is said, until a towel moistened with Cologne water is applied to<br>
his nostrils. Sometimes, however, he varies the monotony of this method by<br>
riding several miles in a Third Avenue car, which produces a similar<br>
effect. OAKEY HALL writes his best things while riding on horseback in<br>
Central Park; his saddle being arranged with a writing-desk accompaniment;<br>
and while OAKEY dashes off the sentences, his horse furnishes the Stops.<br>
And just here we propose to stop furnishing further revelations concerning<br>
the men whose deeds have made their names famous in current national and<br>
local history.</p>

No one now believes that DR. LIVINGSTONE was burnt for sorcery. The<br>
originator of the report could have made a more plausible story by<br>
asserting that LIVINGSTONE refused to marry the daughter of an African<br>
chief, and was consequently put to death. This would have been strictly in<br>
accordance with the customs of the African aristocracy, and would also have<br>
called forth general admiration for the man who preferred to burn rather<br>

<h3>
HAMLET FROM A RURAL POINT.</h3></center>
<center>
<table summary="">
<tr><td>
<p>The Great FECHTER as HAMLET has given us another proof of the brilliant<br>
imagination of Mr. DICKENS. The play is so well known that a synopsis of it<br>
is unnecessary. Yet a few words on the subject.</p>

<p>An economical mother in high society permits baked meats left from a<br>
funeral festival to be served at a subsequent entertainment. Her son takes<br>
umbrage at this; becomes morose and sullen; affects spiritualism and<br>
private theatricals. This leads to serious family difficulties, culminating<br>
in a domestic broil of unusual violence. The intellectual aim of the piece<br>
is to show the extraordinary loquacity of a Danish Prince. The moral<br>
inculcated by it is, "Spare the rod and spoil the child." It is replete<br>
with quotations from the best authors, and contains many passages of marked<br>
ability. Its literary merit is unquestionable, though it lacks the vivacity<br>
of BOUCICAULT, and possesses no situation of such intense interest as the<br>
scene in ROSINA MEADOWS where the heroine starts for Boston.</p>

<p>Mr. FECHTER presents HAMLET as a perfect "flaxy;" partly in deference to<br>
the present popularity of the tint, and partly to show a marked contrast<br>
with his OTHELLO, which character he always makes up as a male brunette.<br>
His countenance is of great breadth and flexibility, ranging in its full<br>
compass from the Placid Babe to the Outraged Congressman. His voice extends<br>
from B flat <i>profundo</i> to the <i>ut de poitrine piccolo</i>. The<br>
emotional nature of HAMLET gives him opportunity to exhibit both of these<br>
wonderful organs, and in <i>tutta forza</i> passages, where he forces them<br>
to their utmost power, the effect is exhilarating.</p>

<p>Mr. FECHTER is polished. He does not hesitate to correct the sometimes rude<br>
and occasionally offensive remarks of HAMLET. Mr. FECHTER is refined. He<br>
permits "no maggots in a dead dog." He substitutes "trichinae in<br>
prospective pork." Fashionable patrons will appreciate this. They cherish<br>
poodles, particularly post-mortem; they disdain swine. Mr. FECHTER is<br>
polite. He excludes "the insolence of office," and "the cutpurse of the<br>
empire and the rule." Collector BAILEY'S "fetch" sits in front. Mr. FECHTER<br>
is fastidious. He omits the prefatory remarks to "assume a virtue," but<br>
urges his mother to seek relief in Chicago. Considering her frivolous<br>
conduct and the acrid colloquy consequent upon the comparison of<br>
photographs, this is filial as well as affectionate.</p>

<p>Minor actors must, of course, be precluded from liberties with the text;<br>
but presuming the alterations in question to be the result of a<br>
consultation with Mr. DICKENS, we must rejoice that SHAKESPEARE is being<br>
toned to good society. We commend the improved readings to the delicate<br>
susceptibilities of the community.</p>

<p>Mr. FECHTER is a great genius. Distinguished talent is occasionally needed<br>
to elevate the national taste. How we have outraged theatrical proprieties<br>
by applauding WALLACK and BOOTH and DAVENPORT!<br>
FORREST, forget us. FECHTER,<br>
forgive us.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, I <i>don't</i> like neighbors. I <i>do</i> like
civilization. The trouble is, neighbors are not always civilized.
PUNCHINELLO will be impressed with the fact before becoming a single
weekling. The first floor may be ever so nice, quiet, well-dressed, proper
folks&mdash;but those dreadful musical people in the attic! I hate musical
people; that is, when in the chrysalis state of learning. Practice makes
perfect, indeed; but practice also makes a great deal of noise. Noise is
another of my constitutional dislikes. If these matters must be divided,
give me the melody, and whoever else will, may take the noise. The truth
is, my dear PUNCHINELLO&mdash;and I may as well begin calling you what the
public will do one of these early days&mdash;there is nothing like notes. But
bank-notes are my weakness. My weakness in that direction is, I may
confidently state, very strong. The ladies are not the only greenbacks that
are accepted at sight; and acceptable to it. The bank on which I should
like to dwell&mdash;do you not guess it?&mdash;is the auriferous National. Those
musical neighbors-how they do play, though! But, to borrow from Mr. SLANG,
my queer neighbor opposite, they have about played out. Our gentlemanly
landlord&mdash;all landlords are so very gentlemanly, kind, good, and
considerate&mdash;Mr. GRABB, says it don't pay to keep such tenants.</p>
</td></tr>

<p>"Mr. GRABB, pay&mdash;pray, why don't it pay?"</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. TODD, why, sir&mdash;because <i>they</i> don't pay. D'ye see it, Mr.<br>
TODD?"</p>

<p>Mr. TODD did see it.</p>

<p>"Music hath charms," and all that fine thing; but it can't evidently charm<br>
a landlord, as at present constructed, into the faith that the notes of a<br>
fiddle, a clarionet, a bugle, or a trombone are negotiable at the corner<br>
grocery, or in Wall and State streets.</p>

<p>Going from bars to banks is a distance. But when I go anywhere, I like to<br>
have it distant. The enjoyment is invariably greater. It saves my tailors,<br>
hatters, restaurant keepers, and some others, the expense and trouble of<br>
too much correspondence. Such isn't good for the brain&mdash;especially where it<br>
is small, and easily overtaxed. "Distance lends enchantment to the view."<br>
May I ask, is or was distance in the brokerage line that it lent<br>
enchantment to the view? and what might possibly have been the conditions<br>
on which the loan was made? The man who leaves his country for its (and<br>
his) good has an especial fondness for the distant. The further off the<br>
nearer he feels like home. Australia is an El Dorado&mdash;the antipodes a<br>
celestial region. The intervening sea is one over which the most<br>
penetrating of argus-eyed policemen or sheriffs, can not see. Australia&mdash;is<br>
it not the land of gold? Who that has poached a pile does not gravitate<br>
there, as the needle to the pole? Of course, I do not mean the<br>
sewing-machine needle.</p>

<p>Some people think California greater. I don't. The greatness of a country<br>
does not in all cases turn on its great rogues. New-York and Washington may<br>
not assent; but, Mr. PUNCHINELLO, isn't it so? These may give it character,<br>
but of the sort nobody is anxious to carry in his pocket as a wedge by<br>
which to enter good, genteel society. "Character," says a leading mind, "is<br>
every thing." Quite true; and if of the right sort, will take a man<br>
speedily to the noose. Biddy can get the most stunning of characters at the<br>
first corner for half a week's wages or&mdash;stealings. As a general thing, I<br>
don't believe in characters, and for the reason that a large portion of my<br>
acquaintances&mdash;I go into society a great deal&mdash;do not appear to have a bit<br>
of the article. They say it is unnecessary; that "society" don't demand it;<br>
and that to have it is like travelling with baggage which is mere rubbish.<br>
My elastic but excellent friend JENKINS says the only sense that can be put<br>
on society market to practical advantage is the uncommon scamp. Common<br>
sense, so-called, is a drug. Old Mr. MATTEROFACT&mdash;who heeds him or his?<br>
He's always pushed into the corner, or crowded to the back seat. Sensible<br>
people, the world being judges, are a mistake. They were born and educated<br>
that way. They don't definitely belong anywhere. Trespassers, interlopers,<br>
impertinents-why should they be tolerated? Doesn't CONGRESSMAN SURFACE, of<br>
the Forty-fourth District, rule the roast? Isn't Mrs. SIMPLE the pattern<br>
Woman of the Swell-Front avenue? Who so charming as Widow MILKWATER? Common<br>
sense might have done once, but that was when the world was younger and yet<br>
more old-fashioned. It isn't available now. Rust never shines. Out upon it,<br>
or let it get out. The best place, I would suggest, is out of town&mdash;and in<br>
the woods. Strangers always make people feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Need I hint just now that it is Lent? Lent is suggestive. It suggests some<br>
of my best books. Books are the best of friends. They are honest. They say<br>
what they feel, and feel what they say. Like other blessings, too, they<br>
often take to wings and fly; and it proves to be a fly that never returns.<br>
A good book is a joy forever. The only sad thing about it is, that it keeps<br>
lent all the time&mdash;not so much piously as profanely. Am I my brother's<br>
keeper? No. But my brother is quite too often a keeper of mine&mdash;of mine own<br>
choice authors. The best of friends are, of course&mdash;like the best of<br>
steaks&mdash;rather rare. Like honest men they count only one in ten<br>
thousand&mdash;an extremely small per cent in a commercial point of view.<br>
Books&mdash;what should we do without them? What may we not do with them, if it<br>
were not for the season of Lent?</p>

<p>I am something of a politician. My friends do not think I am. But they are<br>
prejudiced&mdash;friends always are. I go, on principle, for the greatest good<br>
of the greatest number. You know that humble, initial figure. I confess to<br>
a love of loaves and fishes. A nice French loaf, and a delicious salmon in<br>
the suburbs of green peas&mdash;who wouldn't be a politician about that time? I<br>
have run for office&mdash;and at least half a dozen times. But, bless you, I<br>
never caught it. Some big, burly, brainless cur of a fellow was always<br>
ahead of me. Very queer in politics&mdash;the less the head the more one gets<br>
ahead. A head is little or nothing; but face, cheek, assurance&mdash;such is<br>
much; is every thing. What are politics but audacity? what professions of<br>
public good but pretences for private pap? I like politics. Politics,<br>
however, don't seem to like me. I call myself a patriot; but, strangely<br>
enough, or otherwise, I have never been called to fill a patriot's<br>
office&mdash;say for $5000 and upward per year. As for a patriot's grave&mdash;it's a<br>
fine thing, no doubt, but I have never regarded it as my "mission" to fill<br>
that. It affects one's activity and usefulness, and cuts off going to<br>
FECHTER BOOTH, <i>Frou-Frou</i>, the <i>Twelve Temptations</i>, and opera.<br>
I declined all such honors during the war, and on principle; the principal<br>
thing being that I had no taste for lead and iron. Iron, I know, is good<br>
for the blood; but taken in bullets, it lessens instead of increases the<br>
circulation. These metals are quite too much for a delicate stomach. Shells<br>
as a drink I like; shells as bombs I do <i>not</i> like. They are<br>
unhealthy. As a beverage I can surround it several times a day, and bless<br>
the climate that grows it, and the cask that makes it. But of shells, as of<br>
company, I prefer to make my choice. I, too, have my choice of office. I am<br>
strong and can draw well. My <i>forte</i> is drawing salary. That may not<br>
be the highest form of art, but it is unquestionably artful. Moreover, it<br>
is the one mankind, if it could, would cultivate with the most assiduity.<br>
It is the plaster every man would put to his back.</p>

<p>As a politician I believe in myself first, my pocket second, my country<br>
third. This platform is strong and satisfactory&mdash;at least to your friend,</p>

<p>Mr. DRAKE, who has been studying elocution under a graduate of the Old<br>
Bowery, and has acquired a most tragic croak, which, with a little rouge<br>
and burnt cork, and haggard hair, gives him a truly awful aspect, remarked<br>
that the soil of the South was clotted with blood by fiends in human shape,<br>
(sensation in the diplomatic gallery.) The metaphor might be meaningless;<br>
but it struck him it was strong. These fiends were doubly protected by<br>
midnight and the mask. In his own State the Ku-Klux ranged together with<br>
the fierce whang-doodle. His own life had been threatened. (Faint<br>
applause.) He had received an express package marked in large letters,<br>
"D.H." The President of the United States, an expert in express packages,<br>
had told him this meant "Dead Head." Was this right? Hah! Bellud!! Gore was<br>
henceforth his little game. He would die in his seat. (Great cheering,<br>
which rendered the remainder of the senator's remarks inaudible.)</p>

<p>The case of the admission of General AMES as a senator from Mississippi<br>
came up. Senator CONKLING said that he had no objection to AMES in<br>
particular; but in Brigadier-General, he considered the principle of<br>
letting in men who elected themselves to be bad. Notoriously, General AMES<br>
did not live in Mississippi. He considered this rather creditable to<br>
General AMES'S good sense than otherwise. But did it not operate as a<br>
trivial disqualification against his coming here to represent Mississippi?<br>
Besides, if generals were allowed to elect themselves, where would it end?<br>
General AUGUR, he believed, commanded the Indian district. He would send<br>
himself to the Senate from that region, and be howling about the Piegan<br>
massacre and such outrages upon his constituents, with which the Senate had<br>
been sickened already. In that case AUGUR, he grieved to say, would be a<br>
Bore. Then there is CANBY, who commands in Virginia. CANBY would like to be<br>
a senator, no doubt, like other people who never tried it; and he will be<br>
if he CANBY. A distinguished friend of his in the other house, whom it<br>
would be detrimental to the public service for him to name, if this<br>
military representation were to be recognized, instead of sitting for a<br>
district in Massachusetts, would represent Dutch Gap. They had already, in<br>
his friend from Missouri, a representative of the German Flats; and he<br>
submitted that a member from Dutch Gap would be two tonic for the body<br>
politic.</p>

<p>Mr. HOWARD was in favor of the admission of AMES. He considered the<br>
arguments of the last speaker paltry, and his puns beneath contempt. What<br>
difference did it make whether AMES represented Mississippi or not?<br>
Mississippi was disloyal, and didn't deserve to have any representative.<br>
AMES was a good fellow, and a good officer. Besides, he had been through<br>
West-Point and knew something. He understood he played a very fair game of<br>
billiards, and he would be an ornament to the Senate. Let us let him in.<br>
The Senate had already let in REVELS, who had been sent by AMES; and it was<br>
absurd to keep out AMES, who was the master of the REVELS. He considered<br>
that, in the language of a manly sport with which senators were familiar,<br>
he "saw" Senator CONKLING'S puns, and went several better, though he did<br>
not wish to be considered a better himself.</p>

<p>All this time, singular to say, Senator SUMNER remained silent.</p>

<p>
HOUSE.</p>

<p>
The House had a little amusement over polygamy in Utah. That institution<br>
shocks Mr. WARD, of New-York, and naturally also Mr. BUTLER, of<br>
Massachusetts. Mr. WARD was astonished to see any member standing up in<br>
defence of polygamy in the nineteenth century. If some member should stand<br>
up in any other century and defend it, it would not astonish him at all. It<br>
was sheer inhumanity to refuse to come to the rescue of our suffering<br>
brethren in Utah. How a man who had one wife could consent to see fellow-<br>
creatures writhing under the infliction of two or three each, was what, Mr.<br>
WARD remarked, got over him. Mr. BUTLER pointed out how much money the<br>
Mormons had made.</p>

<p>Mr. Cox did not see why we should interfere by force to prevent a man's<br>
marrying as many wives as he chose. Such a man was his own worst enemy; and<br>
his crime carried its own punishment.</p>

<p>Mr. HOOPER, of Utah, said the bill was an outrage. By all the wives that he<br>
held most sacred, he felt impelled to resent it. MOSES was a polygamist;<br>
hence his meekness. If this sort of thing was continued, no man's wives<br>
would be safe. His own partners would be torn from him, and turned out upon<br>
the world. He scorned to select from among them. Take all or none.</p>

THE MARRIAGE MARKET IN ROME.</h3></center>


<center>
<table summary="">
<tr><td>
<p>
The business of catching impecunious counts, of magnetizing bankrupt<br>
marquises, and of plucking penniless princes, as practised by American<br>
women, appears to absorb all the attention in Rome at present. The rage for<br>
titles is said to be so great among some classes of Americans resident in<br>
the Holy City, that the only song one hears at evening parties and<br>
receptions is the one commencing,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I can read my title clear."</p>

<p>We should not be surprised any day to hear that a marriage market had been<br>
opened on one of the plazas of Rome, the quotations of which would read<br>
something after this fashion: Husbands dull and declining; American<br>
beauties more active; foreign mammas less firm; American securities in<br>
great demand; the market in princes somewhat stronger; holders of titles<br>
much sought after; brains without money a drug in the market; "bogus"<br>
counts at a discount; the genealogy market panicky and falling; the stock<br>
of nobility rapidly depreciating; the pedigree exchange market flat and<br>
declining, etc., etc. This traffic in titles, this barter in dowries, this<br>
swapping of "blood" for dollars, is an offense too rank for words to embody<br>
it. The trade in cadetships is mild in comparison with it, because in these<br>
commercial transactions with counts, while one party may be the purchaser,<br>
both parties are inevitably seen to be sold. The business may only be<br>
excusable on the theory that "an even exchange is no robbery." But so long<br>
as brains are not bartered for a title, or beauty sacrificed for a<br>
pedigree, we should not complain. Of money, there is plenty in America;<br>
and, while marquises are in the market, let Shoddy continue to pipe for its<br>
own. A fig for Macbeth's philosophy that "blood will have blood." We modify<br>
it in these degenerate days to "blood will have money:"</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

     gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
